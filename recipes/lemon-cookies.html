    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat oven</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter, sugar, and lemon zest on medium-high speed, until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter,sugar, and lemon zest:</strong> Beat in egg until well combined. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients and dry ingredients:</strong> On low speed, add the flour mixture and blend until just incorporated.</li>
        <li><strong>Portion out and flatten out the dough balls:</strong> Using a medium spring-loaded cookie scoop, drop 1 Â½-tablespoon sized balls of cookie dough onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Roll each ball with your palms, then using your palm, gently flatten the dough to about 1/3-inch thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> In preheated oven for 12-14 minutes or until cookies are just set and slightly golden brown at the edges. Cool cookies on their baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the glaze:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together powdered sugar and lemon juice until a very thick but pourable glaze forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Glaze the cookies:</strong> Spoon each cooled cookie with the lemon glaze. Garnish with extra lemon zest, if desired.</li>
